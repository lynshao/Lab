DEEP-IoT: Downlink-Enhanced Efficient-Power Internet of Things
=====================

At the heart of the Internet of Things (IoT) -- a domain witnessing explosive growth -- the imperative for energy efficiency and the extension of device lifespans has never been more pressing. In this line of research, we present DEEP-IoT, a revolutionary communication paradigm poised to redefine how IoT devices communicate. Through a pioneering "listen more, transmit less" strategy, DEEP-IoT challenges and transforms the traditional transmitter (IoT devices)-centric communication model to one where the receiver (the access point) play a pivotal role, thereby cutting down energy use and boosting device longevity. We not only conceptualize DEEP-IoT but also actualize it by integrating deep learning-enhanced feedback channel codes within a narrow-band system. Simulation results show a significant enhancement in the operational lifespan of IoT cells -- surpassing traditional systems using Turbo and Polar codes by up to 52.71%. This leap signifies a paradigm shift in IoT communications, setting the stage for a future where IoT devices boast unprecedented efficiency and durability.

Semantic communications
=====================

Semantic communication is an emerging research topic that has gained a wide range of attention recently. Despite this growing interest, there remains a notable absence of a comprehensive and widely-accepted framework for characterizing semantic communication. In this line of research, we introduce a new conceptualization of semantic communication and formulates two fundamental problems, which we term "language exploitation" and "language design". Our contention is that the challenge of language design can be effectively situated within the broader framework of joint source-channel coding theory, underpinned by a comprehensive end-to-end distortion metric.
To tackle the language exploitation problem, we put forth three approaches: semantic encoding, semantic decoding, and a synergistic combination of both in the form of combined semantic encoding and decoding. Furthermore, we establish the semantic distortion-cost region as a critical framework for assessing the language exploitation problem. For each of the three proposed approaches, the achievable distortion cost region is characterized. Overall, our goal is to shed light on the intricate dynamics of semantic communication, paving the way for a deeper understanding of this evolving field.

LLMind: Integrating Large language Model with Wireless Communication Systems
=====================

The exploration of large language models (LLMs) for task planning and IoT automation has recently gained significant attention. However, existing works suffer from limitations in terms of resource accessibility, complex task planning, and efficiency. In this line of research, we present LLMind, an LLM-based AI agent framework that enables effective collaboration among IoT devices for executing complex tasks. Inspired by the functional specialization theory of the brain, our framework integrates an LLM with domain-specific AI modules, enhancing its capabilities. Complex tasks, which may involve collaborations of multiple domain-specific AI modules and IoT devices, are executed through a control script generated by the LLM using a Language-Code transformation approach, which first converts language descriptions to an intermediate finite-state machine (FSM) before final precise transformation to code. Furthermore, the framework incorporates a novel experience accumulation mechanism to enhance response speed and effectiveness, allowing the framework to evolve and become progressively sophisticated through continuing user and machine interactions.
