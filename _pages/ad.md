* Regular Ph.D. Program 2025: Our lab will offer positions to 2 students with full Ph.D. Assistantship support, providing a monthly stipend of MOP12,500~14,000 for four years. You can also encouraged to apply for the Macao Ph.D. Scholarship, which offers MOP20,000 per month for four years. The scholarship is more substantial, but it's also competitive, yet I am committed to offering full support.

* Joint Ph.D. Program 2025 with 中国科学院深圳先进技术研究院/深圳理工大学: Our lab will offer 2 positions under a joint Ph.D. program designed to cultivate high-level talent with a global outlook and robust integration across academia, industry, and research. Successful candidates will be co-supervised by Dr. Qiaoqiao Zhou at 中国科学院深圳先进技术研究院/深圳理工大学, focusing on Information Theory and its applications in machine learning.

Msc
========
We welcome Msc students in the University of Macau to join our lab and embark on their graduate research projects. Our lab is at the forefront of research in wireless communication systems and deep learning. If you haven't settled on a specific research topic, we can assist you in shaping your research direction. If you already have a particular research question that piques your interest, we encourage you to delve deeper into it. 

Here's a valuable tip: starting your journey in the lab as early as possible. This grants you more time for scientific exploration, and hence higher-quality research.
