For the Ph.D. program in 2024, we are offering positions to 2 students with Ph.D. Assistantship support, providing a monthly stipend of MOP14,000 for four years. 

You can also encouraged to apply for the Macao Ph.D. Scholarship, which offers MOP20,000 per month for four years. The scholarship is more substantial, but it's also competitive, yet I am committed to offering full support.

We are also looking for a Research Assistant (RA) with expertise in both communication systems and machine learning. The position is available immediately, offering a monthly salary of MOP14,000 for one year. Strong coding skills are required.

Please send your CV, undergraduate (and graduate, if any) transcript, and English certificate (CET6 is acceptable) to ylshao@um.edu.mo.
