For the Ph.D. program in 2024, we are offering positions to 2 students with Ph.D. Assistantship support, providing a monthly stipend of MOP14,000 for four years. 

You can also encouraged to apply for the Macao Ph.D. Scholarship, which offers MOP20,000 per month for four years. The scholarship is more substantial, but it's also competitive, yet I am committed to offering full support.

Please send your CV, undergraduate (and graduate, if any) transcript, and English certificate (CET6 is acceptable) to ylshao@um.edu.mo.


Msc
========
We welcome Msc students in the University of Macau to join our lab and embark on their graduate research projects. Our lab is at the forefront of research in wireless communication systems and deep learning. If you haven't settled on a specific research topic, we can assist you in shaping your research direction. If you already have a particular research question that piques your interest, we encourage you to delve deeper into it. 

Here's a valuable tip: starting your journey in the lab as early as possible. This grants you more time for scientific exploration, and hence higher-quality research.

RA
========
We are looking for a Research Assistant (RA) with expertise in both communication systems and machine learning. The position is available immediately, offering a monthly salary of MOP14,000 for one year. Strong coding skills are required.
